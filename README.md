Project created using `create-react-app`

### Some notes

The app is using `emotion` instead of `styled-components` due to smaller bundle size. `react-router-redux` doesn't support newest `react-router`, therefore `connected-react-router` is used. Update operation on notes is intentionally omitted - similar to create operation.
